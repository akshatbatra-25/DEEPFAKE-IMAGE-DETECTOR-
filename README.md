This project implements a deepfake image detection system using a ResNet50-based convolutional neural network trained to classify images as real or fake. The model was trained in Google Colab using a Tesla T4 GPU with mixed precision (AMP) for faster performance and achieved approximately 80.6% validation accuracy, demonstrating solid baseline results with room for improvement through fine-tuning and additional training. The dataset consists of thousands of labeled real and manipulated images, processed with resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve generalization. This repository includes all essential training, evaluation, and inference scripts, along with a simple web interface that allows users to upload an image and receive a prediction. Model weights are not included due to size limitations and must be downloaded separately. Overall, the project provides a complete, functional pipeline for deepfake classification, and serves as a foundation for further experimentation, performance tuning, and deployment on external hosting platforms.
